# ChatBot

*A lab report by Natalie B. Abrams*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

**Describe what changes you made to the baseline chatbot here. Don't forget to push your modified code to this repository.**

I made my chatbot into a guessing game. First, the bot randomly generates a number between 1 and 100. Then the player interacting with the chatbot has 5 guesses to guess the number that the bot selected. After each guess, the bot will tell you if you are too low or too high, and if you get the right number you win! If you lose, it also tells you what the winning number was. I also changed the color to green :)

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

**Using a phone or other video device, record someone trying out your ChatBot. Upload that video to this repository and link to it here!**
